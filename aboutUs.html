      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>Welcome to DiagnoAI, your intelligent medical assistant revolutionizing healthcare through the power of deep learning and computer vision. We are a dedicated team hailing from the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Organization Student Chapter at the University of South Florida, where our passion for technology and innovation drives us to explore groundbreaking solutions in the field of healthcare.</p> 
      <p>Our journey began with a shared enthusiasm for leveraging technology to address critical challenges in the medical domain. As tech enthusiasts majoring in various tech-related disciplines, we recognized the immense potential of artificial intelligence in transforming the way we approach medical diagnostics. This realization inspired the creation of DiagnoAI, an intelligent medical assistant that employs cutting-edge deep learning and computer vision algorithms to analyze medical imaging, specifically X-rays, and interpret complex data from blood test reports.</p> 
      <p>The initial prototype of DiagnoAI focuses on analyzing X-rays and blood test reports, providing a glimpse into the future of healthcare diagnostics. We are thrilled to present our project at the Engineering Expo, an opportunity that allows us to showcase our hard work, dedication, and the potential impact of DiagnoAI to fellow students and esteemed professors.</p> 
      <p>At the heart of our project is a commitment to advancing the intersection of technology and healthcare. DiagnoAI aims to contribute to the ongoing evolution of medical diagnostics, offering a glimpse into a future where intelligent algorithms collaborate seamlessly with healthcare professionals to enhance patient outcomes.</p> 
      <p>Join us on this exciting journey as we navigate the realms of technology and healthcare, and together, let's shape the future of diagnostics with DiagnoAI.</p>
